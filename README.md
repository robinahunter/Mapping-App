# Freshwater Fountains Across Maui

## About This App 

This is a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application. 

The Freshwater Fountains Across Maui project is aimed at eliminating single-use plastic on Maui. The project will create an app that provides information, maps, and directions to all accessible freshwater fountains across Maui, including the islands of Maui, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi.
 
The app will initially focus on 15-30 locations across the island of Maui, with the intention of educating people about the source of Maui's water, how it is filtered through lava rock, and the percentage that comes from the underground Maui aquifer, which is the largest water source in the state. The app will also provide information about other filtered sources. Moreover, it will highlight the unique benefits of Maui's water, and pull in resources from the Maui Water Department, the Department of Hydrology at the University of Hawaii Mānoa, folklore and legend, Hawaiian language, Ahupua’a and Moku, and QR codes for easy access to the app.

As a curious traveler exploring the beauty of Maui, I want to use the app to discover the cultural significance and stories behind the freshwater sources across the island, enriching my understanding of Hawaiian heritage and fostering a deeper connection with the land.

As a student passionate about Hawaiian culture and history, I want to use the app to delve deeper into the intricate relationship between freshwater sources and traditional Hawaiian land management practices, enhancing my understanding of indigenous wisdom and stewardship principles.

## Stretch Goals 
As stretch goals the app will feature a scavenger hunt across the island, and users can earn a prize, such as a custom water flask. The app will also have interactive features such as, if a user is near a water fountain, information about it will pop up.
